# Automation-test-with-DataBase

This project contains automated test scripts that use **database-driven test data**.  
The tests are executed on the **Automation Test Store** website:

🔗 https://automationteststore.com/

## Database Used
The test data is retrieved from an online sample database called **classicmodels**, which is commonly used for learning and testing database integrations.

## Purpose
The main goal of this project is to practice:
- UI test automation  
- Integrating automated tests with a database  
- Fetching dynamic test data from a database instead of hard-coded values  

## Notes
- This project is for educational and testing purposes only.  
- The **classicmodels** database is used as a data source and is not related to the website itself.  
- No real transactions or sensitive data are involved.  

### Test Case Execution
To check the test cases, please make sure to:
- Set `enabled = true` for the test case you want to run.  
- Ensure the **priority sequence is correct** to maintain the proper execution order.
